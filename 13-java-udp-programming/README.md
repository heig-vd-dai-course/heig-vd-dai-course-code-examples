# Java UDP programming

This repository contains several examples of UDP emitters/receivers and
clients/servers applications.

We recommend you to try each example and understand how it works.

They are ordered by complexity. You should explore them in the following order:

- [Multicast emitter/receiver](./01-fire-and-forget-messaging-pattern/README.md)
- [Unicast client/server](./02-request-response-messaging-pattern/README.md)

## Usage

To run the examples, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Compile the example
javac <ExampleName>.java

# Run the example
java <ExampleName>
```
