# Java TCP programming

Some of these examples are based on the original course by O. Liechti and J. Ehrensberger.

We recommend you to try each example and understand how it works.

## Usage

To run the examples, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Compile the example
javac <ExampleName>.java

# Run the example
java <ExampleName>
```

Please be aware that some examples require to be run in a specific order (the server before the client for example).

For SmtpClientExample, you will need to launch a MailHog instance, for example via what was presented in 11-smtp-and-telnet.

There are only one client/server implementation for binary data as it is the same as the one for text data.
